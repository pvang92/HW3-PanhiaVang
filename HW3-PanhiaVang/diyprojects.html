                <h4>Blanket Ladder, Home sign</h4>
                <p>
                    "Blanket Ladder" has been such a trendy aesthetic decor, but it is so
                    pricey. By watching a YouTube video tutorial I was able to get this
                    project done within $15. The steps process was very beginner
                    friendly. The project itself was not a lengthy timeframe either, it took
                    me 2 days to get it done. By doing it yourself, you have the free
                    reign to customizing the project to liking. Within the same timeframe on working on the project, I
                    was able to diy a sign decor, "Home" sign. It was a super easy project and cost me zero dollar
                    because I had the materials on hand already.

                <h4>Dollar Tree Fall Wreath</h4>
                <p>I feel like wreath decor is a home staple decoration, but they can be pretty expensive varying where
                    you buy it. I enjoy making my own wreath because I can be creative with it and the amount I spend on
                    the materials is under $15. All the materials that I purchased was from Dollar Tree. At Dollar Tree,
                    there's ton of option to chose from as well. The process to making it was pretty straightforward. It
                    was just how you chose to layout the florals to make it look put together and choosing a color
                    palette. The hard part to it, is to build a strong foundation for the floral picks. The time I put
                    into it was less than an hour.
