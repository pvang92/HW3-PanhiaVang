        <h4>RIP Kiba, May 28, 2020</h4>
        <p>Loving you was easy, but saying goodbye to you was the hardest. 10 years of bonding and just like that in a
          blink of an eye, it's already time for you to leave. You have taught me a lot things about myself that I
          didn't know. Within our times together, I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did. I'm blessed to had encounter
          you in life, throughout the times that you had kept me company and shower me with joys.

        <h4>Our barker, Puck....</h4>
        <p>Boy oh boy, you can bark up a storm, but I love you. I wish for you every year to keep staying healthy
          because I will not be ready that day. I can't said how I appreciated having you in my life. With you by my
          side, I always know that I don't need to be afraid and is protected. Your comfort that warm my heart when I'm
          sad and breaking down crying. You are such a smart dog, your ability to read the room environment or people emotions.
